## Features in Detail

### AI-Powered Tagging System

The application simulates an AI tagging system that:
- Analyzes document content and filename
- Suggests relevant tags with confidence scores
- Provides reasoning for suggestions
- Learns from user feedback (simulated)
- Supports manual tag creation and modification

### Role-Based Permissions

- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, system configuration
- **Manager**: Document and tag management, team document access
- **User**: Personal document management, upload capabilities
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to assigned documents

### Document Management

- Upload multiple file types
- Automatic metadata extraction
- Version tracking and history
- Tag-based organization
- Project-based grouping
- Advanced search capabilities

## Customization

### Theming

The application uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Modify the variables in `src/styles/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #3b82f6;           /* Primary brand color */
  --primary-light: #dbeafe;     /* Light variant */
  --bg-primary: #ffffff;        /* Background color */
  --text-primary: #1f2937;      /* Text color */
  /* ... additional variables */
}
```

### AI Service Integration

Replace the simulated AI service in `src/services/aiTaggingService.js` with your preferred AI/ML service:

```javascript
// Example integration with external AI service
export const aiTaggingService = {
  async analyzeTags(document) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/ai/analyze', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ document })
    });
    return response.json();
  }
};
```
